# SheShines

**SheShines** is a personal self-care web app thoughtfully built for women. It provides a simple, welcoming space to reflect on emotions, track daily moods, write journal entries, and stay motivated through uplifting messages and affirmations.

This project aims to make self-care more accessible and meaningful without requiring users to sign in or share their data.

## How It Works

SheShines is a front-end only web application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires no backend or server-side logic. The app runs entirely in the user's browser and stores user input (moods, tips, journals) locally on their device.

A PDF generation feature is included using the jsPDF library, allowing users to export and save their self-care logs offline.
